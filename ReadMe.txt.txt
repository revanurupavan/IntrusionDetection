Folders: Project Code and Data.
Project Code has the python executable file:Project_code.py. This is our final working code.
Data folder has the sub folder called images which our camera sensor captured and the Shadow state update on the AWS.
Data folder also has certificates which are used for communicating to AWS.

Note: 
1. In the working code, Username and password for Gmail and Dropbox has been removed for security purposes.
2. The Dropbox Uploader package has to be first cloned into the system in order to work.
3. Only few images are being uploaded to the BlackBoard keeping in mind about the storage issues.
